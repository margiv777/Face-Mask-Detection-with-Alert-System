# Face-Mask-Detection-with-Alert-System

## Project Definition

The principal aim of this project is to develop a Deep learning model (CNN) with the help of various frameworks to predict in real-time if a person(s) is wearing a mask or not.

## Project Description
The project “Real-time Face Mask Detection and Alert System“ is a Deep Learning Model and can be classified as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not and generate an alert accordingly.
The model, if detects that the person is not wearing a mask, will alert the concerned authority via e-mail(SMTP Protocol).
The project also aims to create a strong and accurate surveillance system by using modern concepts of AI and Computer Vision.
It is indirectly useful to all Indian citizens as this system can be adopted at various public and private organizations to monitor people not wearing a mask and keep a regular check on those who violate.

## Motivation
As the COVID-19 in India as well as the world spread rapidly, masks were the ultimate and sole solution without a reliable vaccine not being seen to be developed at least for upcoming 8-10 months (March-20-December-20).
As soon as the new year (2021) started, vaccine rolled out in numerous countries including India. As the infection rate and the mortality rate had declined heavily, it was not to conclude to “stop wearing masks” as many of the people did.
There is also being seen a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in various states so as to which we need not to be relieved that “CORONA is GONE!”.
Thus, it felt to us that there was a need to develop a system architecture to monitor people in public wearing a mask, so that necessary checks were made to ensure that everybody wore a mask and those who violated are to be held in offense.
